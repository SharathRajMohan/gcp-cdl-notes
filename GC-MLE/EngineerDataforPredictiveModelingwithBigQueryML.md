# Engineer Data for Predictive Modeling with BigQuery ML
==============================================

## Creating a Data Transformation Pipeline with Cloud Dataprep

Dataprep by Trifacta is an intelligent data service for visually exploring, cleaning, and preparing structured and unstructured data for analysis. In this lab, you explore the Dataprep user interface (UI) to build a data transformation pipeline that outputs results into BigQuery.

Lab Objectives:
- Connect BigQuery datasets to Dataprep.
- Explore dataset quality with Dataprep.
- Create a data transformation pipeline with Dataprep.
- Run transformation jobs and send outputs to BigQuery.

## ETL Processing on Google Cloud Using Dataflow and BigQuery (Python)

In Google Cloud, you can build data pipelines that execute Python code to ingest and transform data from publicly available datasets into BigQuery using these Google Cloud services:

- Cloud Storage
- Dataflow
- BigQuery

Lab Objectives:

- Build and run Dataflow pipelines (Python) for data ingestion
- Build and run Dataflow pipelines (Python) for data transformation and enrichment
